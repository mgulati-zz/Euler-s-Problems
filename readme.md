projectEulerSolutions
=========

In this repo I include my solutions to the problems on the website http://projecteuler.net/

The code for any given solution could be in any language,
but will always be tested to give the right solution.

Everything about the code will be included in the comments.

This is not for people to get the solutions to the problems,
but rather as a motivation for me to start doing them
...and for both myself and others to see how my coding style evolves overtime

Rest assured, I'm doing these for fun, so I would never have looked up a solution online.
That being said, its probably rare you'll find an entirely novel solution to such simple problems.
